# ðŸŽ’ Packing List App

A small React project to practice working with lists and state.  
Users can add items to a packing list, mark them as packed, and remove them.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Managing component state with **useState**
- Updating state arrays with **map**, **filter**, and the spread operator
- Handling **form inputs** (controlled components with `value` + `onChange`)
- Using **props** to pass data and callback functions between components
- Rendering dynamic lists with `.map()` and unique keys
- Conditional rendering and inline styles (e.g. strikethrough for packed items)
